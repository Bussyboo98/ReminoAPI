To handle notifications and reminders efficiently without blocking the main application, asynchronous task processing is essential. Celery is a powerful task queue that integrates seamlessly with Django for this purpose.
Why Celery?
Asynchronous Execution: Perform tasks in the background without delaying HTTP responses.

Scheduled Tasks: Schedule periodic tasks (e.g., daily reminders).

Scalability: Handle a large number of tasks efficiently.
